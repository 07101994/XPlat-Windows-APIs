XamKit is the essential toolkit to make it easier to develop cross-platform applications using Xamarin for UWP, iOS and Android.

## <a id="about">Why XamKit?</a>
Like the WinUX UWP Toolkit, I've set out this time to make it simpler and easier to developer cross-platform applications with Xamarin by unifying the way that each app handles platform specific functionality through a collection of extensions and helpers. 

Hopefully, the development of this toolkit will make it easier for developers to transition to Xamarin who are moving from a single app platform and porting their existing code bases. 

The XamKit will be available through NuGet soon.
